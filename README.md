# ZAMA-Bounty-Program

🎉 Welcome to the Zama Bounty Program
Zama is a cryptography company working on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and other tools that make protecting privacy easy. We started this experimental bounty program to encourage developers from the community to collaborate with us in advancing the FHE space!

The Zama Bounty Program offers monetary rewards for tackling specific challenges.

This initiative aims to inspire and incentivize the developer community to create FHE applications and address problems that can drive FHE technology forward by a decade! Therefore, our Bounty program emphasizes innovation and contribution, rather than bug fixes.
